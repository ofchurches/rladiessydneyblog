      <description>Workshop planAre you new to this R business and short on time? Would you like to start working with data in R without having to go through the arduous process of learning all the programming details first? Do you have a neat data set youâ€™d like to explore and visualise? This might be the workshop for you! Or are you an experienced old school R programmer who learned how to do everything in base R?</description>

      <description>About the Sydney R-Ladies group R-Ladies Sydney is part of a world-wide organization to promote gender diversity in the R community, with Australian chapters in Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane.
The plot to set up a Sydney chapter was hatched by Jenny Richmond , with Danielle Navarro , Lisa Williams  and Steph de Silva  as co-conspirators, and (for the moment at least!) the four of us make up the very friendly leadership group for the chapter.</description>
