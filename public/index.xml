      <description>Basic Basics Lesson 2: Installing and Loading PackagesYou likely won‚Äôt get very far in R without packages. Sure, you could write all the functions you need for your analysis yourself if you wanted, but the great thing about the #rstats community is that people write code, bundle it into packages, and then give them away FOR FREE. Once you are an #rstats expert, you can create your own packages and give back, but for now lets learn what packages are and how to use them.</description>

      <description>RYouWithMe: The inspirationI‚Äôm Lisa Williams, a social psychologist at UNSW Sydney, and co-founder of R-Ladies Sydney. Truth be told, I‚Äôm a complete R newbie. Sure, I‚Äôve executed a few commands here and there. But I‚Äôve found R daunting: the workflow, the pure number of packages, and the ‚Äòcross-your-fingers-and-hope‚Äô nature of executing a command. Yet, increasingly, R is the answer to many of my problems - from data wrangling to visualisation to analysis, the result of my searches for how to achieve something is: ‚Äúyou can do it in R‚Äù.</description>

      <description>About the Sydney R-Ladies group R-Ladies Sydney is part of a world-wide organization to promote gender diversity in the R community, with Australian chapters in Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane.
The plot to set up a Sydney chapter was hatched by Jenny Richmond , with Danielle Navarro , Lisa Williams  and Steph de Silva  as co-conspirators, and (for the moment at least!) the four of us make up the very friendly leadership group for the chapter.</description>
