<li><em>Contact</em>: <a href="mailto:Lovisa.Lannesand@macquarie.com"><i class="fa fa-envelope"></i></a></li>
<li><em>Bio</em>: I am born and raised in Sweden, but at age 18 I was sick of long and cold winters and decided to move to Sydney for 6 months. Seven years has passed and I am still here, however no longer sharing a house with 7 people, and I still love the city! I completed my Bachelor of Business at UTS in Sydney in 2013, and it was during this period I gained an interest in statistics and data science. I now work as a quantitative analyst for Macquarie bank, in the Corporate Asset Finance group. When I first started the role R was completely new to me, but when I realized how efficient and effective the language was I invested the time to learn. Today I use R on a daily basis for a wide range of processes, such as data cleaning / analysis, financial modelling and reporting.</li>
