# CHDSS website

The site is a plain R Markdown website based on the PSYR site. Quick notes: To render the whole site, type 
```
rmarkdown::render_site()
```
at the console. The site itself is in the `_site` subdirectory. To add a webpage to the site, just create a new .Rmd file, and edit the `_site.yml` file if you want to add it to the navigation bar.
