# About the Sydney R-Ladies group

R-Ladies Sydney is part of a world-wide organization to promote gender diversity in the R community, with Australian chapters in [Melbourne](https://twitter.com/RLadiesMelb), [Adelaide](https://twitter.com/RLadiesAdelaide) and [Brisbane](https://twitter.com/RLadiesBrisbane). 

The plot to set up a Sydney chapter was hatched by [Jenny Richmond](http://www.earlylearningsydney.com/) [<i class="fa fa-twitter"></i>](https://twitter.com/JenRichmondPhD), with [Danielle Navarro](https://compcogscisydney.org/) [<i class="fa fa-twitter"></i>](https://twitter.com/djnavarro), [Lisa Williams](http://www.williamssocialemotionslab.com/) [<i class="fa fa-twitter"></i>](https://twitter.com/williamslisaphd) and [Steph de Silva](http://rex-analytics.com/) [<i class="fa fa-twitter"></i>](https://twitter.com/StephdeSilva) as co-conspirators, and (for the moment at least!) the four of us make up the very friendly leadership group for the chapter. We'll organise a more formal contact method shortly but in meantime you can contact us at the twitter accounts linked above, and if you're interested in coming to an event, check out the meetup page (coming soon!)

# About R-Ladies

The [R-Ladies homepage](https://rladies.org/) and [GitHub page](https://github.com/rladies) are both fantastic resources for learning about the organisation and participating within it. The goal is to support gender diversity in the community:

> The R community suffers from an underrepresentation of minority genders (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender) in every role and area of participation, whether as leaders, package developers, conference speakers, conference participants, educators, or users.

> As a diversity initiative, the mission of R-Ladies is to achieve proportionate representation by encouraging, inspiring, and empowering people of genders currently underrepresented in the R community. R-Ladiesâ€™ primary focus, therefore, is on supporting minority gender R enthusiasts to achieve their programming potential, by building a collaborative global network of R leaders, mentors, learners, and developers to facilitate individual and collective progress worldwide.

The [code of conduct](https://rladies.org/code-of-conduct/) for R-Ladies meetups and within R-Ladies spaces more generally is posted on their website, and it's well worth reading!


# About the site

The site is written in R using [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), which in turn relies on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate a static site. The theme is a modest customisation of theme [XMin](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin) theme written by the wonderful [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name). The site is hosted on [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) for no particularly sensible reason. Somewhere in the Rube Goldberg device that generates all this stuff is a tiny kitten who types very quickly.
