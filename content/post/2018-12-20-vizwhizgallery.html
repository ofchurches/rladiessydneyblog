<p>We thought it might be nice to create our own ggplot inspo? plotsperation? gallery? page, so we gave some local folks the Sydney beaches data with rainfall and temperature (<a href="/data/rain_temp_beachbugs.csv">link</a>) and asked them to “make a pretty graph” in no more than 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Here’s what we got! We think they’re fantastic - especially given our imposed time constraint!</p>
<p>Sincerest of thank yous to our contributors: Daniel Falster, Lovisa Lannesand, Sarah Romanes, Adrian Walker, and Wendy Wong!</p>
<div id="bugs-by-beaches-and-year" class="section level1">
<h1>1 Bugs by Beaches and Year</h1>
<p>This plot comes to us from Daniel Falster (Twitter: <span class="citation">@adaptive_plant</span>). Daniel asked: How does the distribution of values change across years and beaches? and used <code>ggbeeswarm</code> and all sorts of fun formatting to get the answer!</p>

<div id="bondi-bugs-by-temperature" class="section level1">
<h1>2 Bondi Bugs by Temperature</h1>
<p>This plot comes to us from Lovisa Lannesand (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lovisa-lannesand-188141176/">LinkedIn</a>). Lovisa asked: Are there more beachbugs on a rainy day? and concludes that the best day for someone who loves Bondi, but does not love beachbugs, to go there should be a really hot day.&quot;</p>

<div id="sydney-rainfall-by-month" class="section level1">
<h1>3 Sydney Rainfall by Month</h1>
<p>This plot comes to us from Sarah Romanes (Twitter: <span class="citation">@sarah_romanes</span>). Sarah plotted average rainfall by month! We think she’s on to something… anyone want to venture a guess about bug levels in May vs. June?</p>

<div id="beachbugs-by-rainy-day" class="section level1">
<h1>4 Beachbugs by Rainy Day</h1>
<p>This plot comes to us from Adrian Walker (Twitter: <span class="citation">@walkerthon2</span>). Adrian explored the relationship between rain and beachbugs in this beaut of a violin plot and concluded that more beachbugs come out when it rains! (eww)</p>

<h1>5 Bug Levels by Beach</h1>
<p>This plot comes to us from Wendy Wong (Twitter: <span class="citation">@abc_wendsss</span>). Wendy did a ton of whizzy wizardy (check out those data prep commands!) and then plotted bugs by beach. Note to selves: maybe give Malabar and Little Bay a miss!</p>
