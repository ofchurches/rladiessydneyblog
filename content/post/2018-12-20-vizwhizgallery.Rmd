We thought it might be nice to create our own ggplot inspo? plotsperation? gallery? page, so we gave some local folks the Sydney beaches data with rainfall and temperature ([link](/data/rain_temp_beachbugs.csv)) and asked them to "make a pretty graph" in no more than 10 minutes. 

Here's what we got! We think they're fantastic - especially given our imposed time constraint! 

Sincerest of thank yous to our contributors: Daniel Falster, Lovisa Lannesand, Sarah Romanes, Adrian Walker, and Wendy Wong!

# 1 Bugs by Beaches and Year

This plot comes to us from Daniel Falster (Twitter: @adaptive_plant). Daniel asked: How does the distribution of values change across years and beaches? and used `ggbeeswarm` and all sorts of fun formatting to get the answer!

# 2 Bondi Bugs by Temperature

This plot comes to us from Lovisa Lannesand ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lovisa-lannesand-188141176/)). Lovisa asked: Are there more beachbugs on a rainy day? and concludes that the best day for someone who loves Bondi, but does not love beachbugs, to go there should be a really hot day."

# 3 Sydney Rainfall by Month

This plot comes to us from Sarah Romanes (Twitter: @sarah_romanes). Sarah plotted average rainfall by month! We think she's on to something... anyone want to venture a guess about bug levels in May vs. June?

# 4 Beachbugs by Rainy Day

This plot comes to us from Adrian Walker (Twitter: @walkerthon2). Adrian explored the relationship between rain and beachbugs in this beaut of a violin plot and concluded that more beachbugs come out when it rains! (eww)

# 5 Bug Levels by Beach

This plot comes to us from Wendy Wong (Twitter: @abc_wendsss). Wendy did a ton of whizzy wizardy (check out those data prep commands!) and then plotted bugs by beach. Note to selves: maybe give Malabar and Little Bay a miss!
