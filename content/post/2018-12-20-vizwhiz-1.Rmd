Before we begin, a preamble...

### Why plot raw data?

Until I^[Jen Richmond, R-Ladies Sydney co-founder and #RYouWithMe screencaster! (Twitter: @JenRichmondPhD)] started learning R about a year ago, I had only ever plotted averaged data. My plots looked like this...

Or this….

In 2016, I remember seeing [#barbarplots](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1474588473/barbarplots)
t-shirts and tote bags at a conference, but back then I didn’t know that the figures were made in R.

> Check out this [video](https://ksr-video.imgix.net/projects/2453455/video-665338-h264_high.mp4) for more info about the #barbarplots kickstarter campaign. And learn how to [explode bar plots](/post/2018-12-20-vizwhiz_files/_Exploding_Barplot.gif) using code from [here](https://zenodo.org/record/574883#.XAUTspMzaRs).

### So, if not bar plots, then what? 

Bar plots with standard error bars obviously have their limitations, but what is the alternative? In this lesson, we’re going to learn about how to plot raw data using `ggplot2`. As in prior units, we'll be using the sydneybeaches dataset, so be sure to have that on hand!

##Lesson Outcomes

By the end of this lesson, you should:

|     1.1 Be able to use `geom_point`, `geom_jitter`, and `geom_quasirandom` to plot raw data
|     1.2 Be able to use colour to differentiate subsets of data
|     1.3 Be able to use `facet_wrap` to plot subsets of data separately
|     1.4 Be able to combine `dpylr` functions like `filter` with `ggplot`
|     1.5 Be able to use `ggsave` to export plots 

##1.1 Plotting bug levels by year

If the councils that look after our beaches are doing their job,  beaches should be less contaminated than they were 5 years ago, right? Let's plot bug levels over time and see whether things seem to be getting better. 

In this screencast, we’ll review:

  * How to write cleaned data to a new csv file
  * How to plot raw data using `geom_point`, `geom_jitter`, and `geom_quasirandom`

</center>  

Here's the plot for reference:

Watch the video and then carry out the following steps:

1. Use `geom_point` to plot buglevels by year
2.  Play with `geom_jitter` and `geom_quasirandom`; which one is your favourite?
3. Check out the `ggbeeswarm` [vignette](https://github.com/eclarke/ggbeeswarm) and try to make your quasirandom plot “smiley” or “frowny”
4.  Try `geom_beeswarm` too!

##1.2 Using colour to plot bug levels by site

There doesn't seem to be an obvious improvement in bug levels in the past 5 years. I wonder whether some beaches are just more variable than others. Let's use colour to differentiate between different sites. 

In this screencast, we’ll review:

  * How to plot raw data using `geom_jitter`
  * How to deal with NAs in your data
  * How to use `coord_flip` to make axis labels visible
  * How to differentiate subsets within your data by changing the point colour
  * How to coerce variables into a different data format

Here's the plot for reference:

<img src="/post/2018-12-20-vizwhiz_files/bugsbybeach_coloryear.png" width=60% align="center">

Watch the video and then carry out the following steps:

1.  Use `geom_jitter` to plot bug levels for each site, differentiating between values from 2013-2018 with different coloured points 
2. Try colouring the points by another variable (perhaps council or month). How does the visualisation change?

##1.3 Using facet_wrap() to plot sites separately

Using colour is one way to differentiate between data points associated with different variables. Alternatively, you can group the data into different mini-plots using facet_wrap. 
In this screencast, we’ll review:

  * How to use `facet_wrap` to visualise beachbug levels across years, separately for each site.

</center>  
  
Here's the plot for reference:

<img src="/post/2018-12-20-vizwhiz_files/bugsbybeach_facetsite_all.png" width=80% align="center">

Watch the video and perform the following steps:

1. Use `geom_jitter` and `facet_wrap` to plot buglevels by year, separately for each site
2. Try plotting buglevels by site, separately for each year. Hint: maybe using `coord_flip` is a good idea!

## 1.4 Putting it all together (dplyr  + ggplot)

What if you only want to compare a couple of sites? Or restrict the range of scores to exclude obvious outliers? You can combine dyplyr functions like `filter` with `ggplot` using the pipe %>%. (The pipe was covered in #RYouWithMe Unit Clean It Up Lesson 1! Need a refresher? Click [here](/post/2018/11/20/clean-it-up-1/)!)

In this screencast, we’ll review:

  * How to use combine `filter` and `ggplot` to plot subsets of your data

Here's the plot for reference:

<img src="/post/2018-12-20-vizwhiz_files/bondicoogee.jpeg" width=50% align="center">

Watch the video and perform the following steps:

1. Pipe a `filter` function and a `ggplot` together to plot only values that are less than 1000
2. Try changing the filter value to only plot values less than 500
3. Use `filter` and `ggplot` to compare data from Coogee and Bondi
4. Pick your two favorite beaches and make a plot that compares the variability in beachbug values

## 1.5 How to get your plots out of R Studio

Of course, these beautiful plots are not much use if they are stuck in R Studio. The easiest way to export your plots and save them elsewhere on your computer is by using `ggsave`.

In this screencast, we’ll review:

  * How to export your plots using `ggsave` and `here`

</center>
  
Watch the video and perform the following steps:

1. Add a `ggsave` call after each chunk of code in your script to save your plots to a folder in your RYouWithMe project called "output"
2. Use the source button to run your code from top to bottom. 
3. For Sydney-based R-Ladies: Pick your favourite exported plot and post it to the #ryouwithme_3_vizwhiz channel on Slack!

## Challenge - plot your own data

The next step is to plot your own data as raw values. 

Steps to plotting your own raw data: 

1. Remember that ggplot only likes "long" data, so if you have observations across several columns, go back to [Clean it up Lesson 4](https://rladiessydney.org/post/2018/11/28/clean-it-up-4/) and brush up on how to convert your wide data into long format 
2. Pick a categorical variable for your x axis
3. Pick a continuous variable for your y axis
4. Try out `geom_point`, `geom_jitter`, or `geom_quasirandom` and see which one makes the most sense for your data
5. Export using `ggsave` 

On to [Lesson 2](/post/2018/12/20/vizwhiz-2/)
