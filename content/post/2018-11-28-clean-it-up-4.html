<p>Learning how to use <code>gather</code> and <code>spread</code> functions might be one of the biggest stumbling blocks that R learners encounter. Even Rlady ed experts like <a href="https://twitter.com/kierisi">Jesse Mostipak</a> freely admit to not really “getting it”.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">
there's a pretty large discrepancy between how well I <em>think</em> I know spread() and gather() and how well I <em>actually</em> know spread() and gather()

<div id="why-do-you-need-to-know-gather-and-spread" class="section level3">
<h3>Why do you need to know gather and spread?</h3>
<p>In R circles there is a lot of talk of the need for “tidy data”. You can read more about what Hadley Wickham (creator of the Tidyverse) means by <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html">tidy data here</a>, but in short, tidy data is when</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Each variable forms a column.</li>
<li>Each observation forms a row.</li>
<li>Each type of observational unit forms a table.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you entered your data in excel, you probably entered it in wide format. Data in wide format has observations spread across several columns; each column contains data from a different condition (or combination of conditions). wide data is messy.</p>
<p>In the wide example below, we have scores from participants who were tested twice (Time 1 and Time 2) after studying different lists of words under two different conditions (Condition 1 and Condition 2).</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>In contrast, data in long format has all the observations in a single column and variables in separate columns.</p>

<div id="should-i-could-copy-and-paste_transpose-the-scores" class="section level3">
<h3>Should I could copy and paste_transpose the scores?</h3>
<p>No, no, no… this is not as hard as it looks. R employs cute monsters under the hood to <code>gather</code> your data from wide to long, and <code>spread</code> it from long to wide. All in a single line of code.</p>

<p>In this lesson, we will use three different examples to illustrate how to use <code>gather</code> and <code>spread</code> to convert your data from wide to long and back to wide.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Great British Bakeoff data from <a href="https://twitter.com/apreshill">Alison Hill</a></li>
<li>Some summary data from our own sydneybeaches dataset</li>
<li>A wickedly complex example from a cognition experiment out of <a href="https://twitter.com/djnavarro">Dani Navarro’s</a> lab</li>
</ol>

<div id="example-1-which-bakers-can-identify-spices" class="section level3">
<h3>Example 1: which bakers can identify spices?</h3>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/apreshill">Alison Hill</a> for sharing this example from her Datacamp course. This data is from a Great British Bakeoff challenge; I assume that bakers were tested on their ability to identify different spices.</p>
<p>The dataframe on the left is in wide format; the performance of each baker in each spice test is listed across different columns.</p>

<p>The dataframe on the right is in long format; all of the accuracy scores are in a single column and information about which baker and spice test each observation came from are represented in separate variables.</p>

<h4>Using <code>gather</code> (wide to long)</h4>
<p>The <code>gather</code> function will change your wide data to long format in a single line of code.</p>
<p>You need to tell it …</p>
<ul>
<li>data= dataframe you want to gather</li>
<li>key = name of column you want to create to capture condition (i.e. spice)</li>
<li>value = name of column you want to contain data values (i.e. correct)</li>
<li>column X:column Y = range of columns that you have and want to gather (cinnamon_1:nutmeg_3)</li>

<h4>Your turn: Challenge 1</h4>
<p>Here is a link to the <a href="/data/bakers_wide.csv">bakers data in wide format</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>download the data and put it in your data folder</li>
<li>open a new script</li>
<li>load the tidyverse and here packages</li>
<li>use <code>here</code> and <code>read_csv</code> to read the bakers data (go back to Basic Basics if you’ve forgotten how this works)</li>
<li>use <code>gather</code> to convert the bakers data from wide to long, replicating Alison’s steps above.</li>

<div id="example-2-long-beaches-are-better-than-wide" class="section level3">
<h3>Example 2: long beaches are better than wide</h3>
<p>The raw sydneybeaches data is helpfully already in long format, but I have created a couple of summary datasets so we can practice changing data from wide to long and back again.</p>
<p>In the wide format, I’ve averaged bug levels for each year and the beach sites appear in separate columns.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>In long format, the bug levels from each site are all in a single column and year and site are represented as separate variables.</p>

<p>In this screencast, I walk you through how to use <code>gather</code> and <code>spread</code> using the sydneybeaches data.</p>

<h3>Example 3: A tricky one</h3>
<p>The bakers data and beaches data are relatively simple. What happens if there is more that one condition that you are trying to gather across?</p>
<p>This sampling frames dataset comes from an experiment from <a href="https://twitter.com/djnavarro">Dani Navarro’s</a> lab. In this study, each participant made reasoning judgements about items either based on a category or property (condition). They made repeated judgements after being given a small, medium, and large “samples” of information. For each of these sampling conditions, there were 7 different items that participants made a judgement about.</p>
<p>Here is what the data looks like in wide format.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2018-11-19-cleanitup_files/frames_wide.png" />

</div>
<p>Each row contains all of the data from a single participant and the column represent information about BOTH sampling condition (small, medium, large) and item (1-7).</p>
<div id="your-turn-challenge-3.1" class="section level4">
<h4>Your turn: Challenge 3.1</h4>
<p>Here is a link to the <a href="/data/frames_wide.csv">frames data in wide format</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>download the data and put it in your data folder</li>
<li>open a new script</li>
<li>load the tidyverse and here packages</li>
<li>use <code>here</code> and <code>read_csv</code> to read the frames data (go back to <a href="/post/2018/11/05/basicbasics/">Basic Basics</a> if you’ve forgotten how this works)</li>
<li>use <code>gather</code> to convert the frames data from wide to long</li>
</ul>

<div id="how-did-you-go" class="section level3">
<h3>How did you go?</h3>
<p>Hopefully you ended up with a data frame that looks something like this.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2018-11-19-cleanitup_files/frameslong_step1.png" />

</div>
<p>Unfortunately though, your work is not done. See how we now have all the ratings in a single column called response, but the “key” column that you created contains information about both the sampling frame AND the item. For the data to be truly tidy, we need that information split into two separate variables.</p>
<div id="your-turn-challenge-3.2" class="section level4">
<h4>Your turn: Challenge 3.2</h4>
<p>Go back to <a href="/post/2018/11/20/clean-it-up-3/">Clean It Up 3</a> and brush up on the <code>separate</code> function.</p>
<ul>
<li>use <code>separate</code> to create two variables for the sample and item information</li>
<li>use <code>arrange</code> to make the dataframe look like this</li>
</ul>

<div id="your-turn-try-your-own-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Your turn: Try your own data</h3>
<p>Is your data in wide format? No problem. Sort out answers to the following questions and you can convert it to long format with a single line of code.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What should your “key” column be called?</li>
<li>What are the “values”?</li>
<li>Which columns do you want to gather?</li>
</ol>
<p>Post a screenshot of your success (or frustration) in the Clean it Up Slack channel.</p>
